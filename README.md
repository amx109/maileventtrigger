a simple python script that:

 gets list of emails from inbox IMAP folder (via TLS)
 plays sound for each email greater than last mail UID
 stores highest email UID

so note: on first run it will play a sound for every mail in the inbox since initial mail UID is set to 1

the sound file was obtained from http://www.freesound.org/people/Benboncan/sounds/91924/
